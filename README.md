ðŸŽ¯ **Retail Recommender System**  
This project builds a personalized recommendation system using SVD on normalized price data (0-5 scale). The model predicts customer purchase behavior with high accuracy (RMSE: 0.0199, MAE: 0.0051) and ensures optimal performance through hyperparameter tuning.  

ðŸ“Š **Features:**  
- Data preprocessing and normalization  
- Model training and evaluation (SVD, NMF, SVD++)  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
- Scalable for new user/item predictions  

ðŸš€ **Final Model:**  
SVD with Normalized Price (Ready for Deployment)
